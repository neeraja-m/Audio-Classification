The objective is to develop classifiers for music genre classification using PyTorch. The dataset includes audio samples for 10 different music genres, and each audio sample has a visual representation constructed using MEL spectrograms.
This will involve creating:

1. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using spectrograms as input. This model includes variations of networks of differing complexity.
2. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units using audio as input.
